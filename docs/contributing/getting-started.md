## Making Your First Contribution

### Finding Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled with:
- `good first issue`: Perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Community contributions welcome
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements needed
- `bug`: Bug fixes that need attention

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make Your Changes**

```bash
# Make your code changes
# Add tests for new functionality
# Update documentation as needed

# Run tests locally
make test

# Run linting
make lint
```

3. **Commit Your Changes**

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add new component validation logic

- Add validation for component resource limits
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation with new validation rules

Fixes #123"
```

4. **Push and Create Pull Request**

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create pull request on GitHub
# Fill out the PR template completely
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add component validation endpoint
fix(cli): resolve authentication token refresh issue
docs(tutorial): add getting started guide
```

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Requirements

Before submitting a PR, ensure:
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions
- [ ] PR description explains the changes
- [ ] Related issues are referenced

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline runs tests and checks
2. **Community Review**: Other contributors review your code
3. **Maintainer Review**: Core maintainers provide final approval
4. **Merge**: Changes are merged into the main branch

### Addressing Review Feedback

```bash
# Make changes based on feedback
# Add new commits or amend existing ones
git add .
git commit -m "address review feedback"

# Push updates
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Write unit tests for all new functionality:

```go
func TestComponentValidation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name      string
        component *Component
        wantErr   bool
    }{
        {
            name: "valid component",
            component: &Component{
                Name: "test-service",
                Type: "service",
            },
            wantErr: false,
        },
        {
            name: "invalid component - missing name",
            component: &Component{
                Type: "service",
            },
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := ValidateComponent(tt.component)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("ValidateComponent() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

Test interactions between components:

```go
func TestComponentDeployment(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup test environment
    client := fake.NewClientBuilder().Build()
    
    // Create test component
    component := &Component{
        ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
            Name:      "test-component",
            Namespace: "test",
        },
        Spec: ComponentSpec{
            Type: "service",
        },
    }
    
    // Test deployment creation
    err := DeployComponent(client, component)
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Verify deployment was created
    deployment := &appsv1.Deployment{}
    err = client.Get(context.TODO(), types.NamespacedName{
        Name:      "test-component",
        Namespace: "test",
    }, deployment)
    assert.NoError(t, err)
}
```
